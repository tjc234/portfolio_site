            <p>I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. My love for tech started early 
            with the internet and gaming, like the Nintendo 64. I taught myself 
            HTML and how to mod games. I've tried a lot of things before settling 
            on software engineering. My varied experiences help me think outside the box.

            <p>I'm into being outdoors, playing disc golf, and camping. I love 
            gaming, especially modding Minecraft and playing Dungeons and Dragons. 
            Music is a big part of my life, from playing instruments to making 
            electronic music and DJing. I also enjoy working on 3D printing and
            Raspberry Pi projects.
